# MoSim 3 Regions Pack

This is a mod for the 2024 FRC game Crescendo created by Mo from team 4089.  

This mod features robots from Chicago, Seattle, and 2 from the San Francisco Bay Area.  
The robots included are 111 Wildstang, 1778 Chill Out, 6036 Peninsula Robotics, and 581 Blazing Bulldogs.

Both 1778 and 581 support climbing while 581 supports trapping as well.

There is both keyboard and controller support.

Huge shoutout to all of the teams for releasing their cad,  
and a huge thanks to Mo, WhiteWolfy, Ryan, and all of the others who enabled me to create this mod.

Enjoy!
